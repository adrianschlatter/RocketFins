PET-Bottle Waterrocket Fins
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is a CAD-model of fins intended to be screwed onto a PET bottle to create a
water rocket. To create the rocket, you need:

- bottle with PCO-1881 threading (e.g. a 1.5-l Coke bottle)
- this part
- Gardena tap connector G 1"
- launcher

(+ water + pressurized air).

Use at your own risk.
